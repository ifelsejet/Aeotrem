        text1: "It’s the question that’s been on everyone’s minds: Will there be a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks? The answer is likely yes, based on a proposal introduced on Monday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. The measure includes new $1,200 stimulus payments, with similar terms to the last set of checks.",
        text2: "Those first payments were for up to $1,200 per individual and $2,400 per couple, as well as $500 for each qualifying child under 17. This time, however, dependents over 17 would also qualify for the money.\n    The income thresholds to qualify would stay the same.",
        text3: "Full payments were made to individuals with up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income, or $150,000 for married couples who filed their taxes jointly. Those with incomes above those levels received payments that were reduced, and were eliminated completely for those with income over $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for couples.",

        text1: "The proposal would impact nearly 32 million Americans currently receiving unemployment benefits — about five times the level of the Great Recession more than a decade ago. ‘Difficult situation’ The experience would vary significantly between states, which set their own benefit levels. In Oklahoma, for example, benefits would fall 62% to $244 a week under the Republican proposal — the most significant decline for any state relative to prior policy. In Hawaii, the decline would be least severe in Hawaii — a 38% cut to $666 a week.",
        text2: "“That’s a pretty difficult situation for people,” Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, said of residents in states paying lesser weekly benefits. “Right now, we know the $600 is working,” she said. “I don’t know what’s different from the pandemic now than in March, except that it’s worse.” Republicans want to cut federal aid for the unemployed due to the belief that it’s too generous and offers a disincentive to find work, thereby tamping down on the economic recovery.",
        text3: "Democrats want to extend the $600-a-week benefit, warning of economic catastrophe without it. Proponents of current policy say it’s well targeted to those most in need of the money and is propping up consumer spending at a delicate time, when coronavirus infections are rising across the country and state officials have imposed new shutdown measures.",

        text1: "Months of economic uncertainty have driven people to turn toward a normally forbidden pot of cash: their retirement savings. The CARES Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law this spring, allows individuals affected by the pandemic to take emergency withdrawals of up to $100,000 from their retirement plans. Savers under age 59½ can now withdraw the sums from their 401(k) and 403(b) accounts without the usual 10% early withdrawal penalty. This also applies to individual retirement accounts.",
        text2: "As more people lose their jobs and millions more face the risk of losing their $600 weekly enhanced federal unemployment benefit, savers have started tapping their retirement accounts. Indeed, 17% of all distributions taken by savers between April 6 and June 26 were “coronavirus-related distributions,” according to an ADP analysis of plans it manages. At Fidelity, 711,000 individuals took a CARES distribution between April 1 and June 30, accounting for 3% of the company’s eligible 401(k) and 403(b) plan participants.",
        text3: "Savers took a median coronavirus-related distribution of $4,800 from their plans, but some 18,600 participants asked for the full $100,000, Fidelity found. Meanwhile, 2% of retirement plan savers at Vanguard took a coronavirus-related distribution through May 31. Of these, 4% were for the maximum amount of $100,000. “It’s a double-edged sword,” said Kristin Andreski, senior vice president and general manager of ADP Retirement Services.",

        text1: "Covid-19 has upended much of U.S. society. And it’s changing how Americans think about money. A survey from money manager Charles Schwab finds their new mantra could very well be, “Less is more.” When it comes to how much it takes to be considered wealthy, Americans now say it’s an average net worth of $2 million to achieve that status, down 23% from $2.6 million in January.",
        text2: "Americans also have a changing view of what it means to be financially comfortable. When asked how much they would need to be comfortable now, respondents said an average of $655,000 in net worth. That’s down 30% from an average of $934,000 cited in January.",
        text3: "The results come as a majority of people — 57% — said they or a family member has been financially impacted by the coronavirus crisis. Millennials are the cohort most likely to feel the stress of the downturn, with 41% indicating they or a family member has been affected financially. Baby boomers, in contrast, were least affected.",

        text1: "Congress won’t move on the next round of stimulus legislation this week. Despite that, however, a second set of stimulus checks is still on the table. Draft legislation released by Senate Republicans states, “These will be included, but the amount of the payment and eligibility are TBA [to be announced].” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this week that the size and scope of the payments will likely be the same as the first round. That is subject to change as negotiations with Democrats ensue.",
        text2: "Those checks were up to $1,200 per individual or $2,400 per married couple, plus $500 for dependents under 17. Eligibility was based on income. Those earning up to $75,000 per individual, or $150,000 per married couple filing jointly, received the full amount. Those who made more than that received reduced payments.",
        text3: "Individuals who make more than $99,000 and married couples with over $198,000 in income were not eligible for the money. A second set of payments would be a concession for some Republicans, who are reluctant to send more money. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., previously suggested lowering the income threshold to those making $40,000 or less.",
