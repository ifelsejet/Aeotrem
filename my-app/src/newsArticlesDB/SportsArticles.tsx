        article1 : {text1: "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers has likened his new surroundings to a youth basketball tournament for grown men who happen to be some of the most recognizable sports stars on the planet."+
        "C.J. McCollum of the Portland Trail Blazers combats the pangs he feels for his fiancée and his dog back home with “my essential oils and my dehumidifier and my books,” and the occasional indulgence in wine he packed."+
        
        "Gone are the ostentatious arena entrances dressed in the finest fashions and the whirl of big-city night life. N.B.A. players have gathered for the most extraordinary experiment in league history: to play out the rest of the season without fans on a confined campus and abide by a thick book of rules that includes assigned seats on the bench and prohibitions on postgame showers until players return to a team hotel. (The W.N.B.A. is engaged in a similar experiment in Bradenton, Fla.)"+
        
        "Life in what everyone calls “the bubble” is at once strange and mundane. With more than 350 players and the staffs of 22 teams thrown together in a restricted-access environment at Walt Disney World to resume this virus-interrupted season, even a routine encounter between two of basketball’s top distance shooters takes on heightened meaning."

        article2 : {text1: "Along with the rest of the world, athletes have had their careers upended by the coronavirus pandemic. They are giving The New York Times an intimate look at their journeys in periodic installments through the rest of the year. Read Stewart’s previous installments here and here."+

        "At long last, Breanna Stewart’s W.N.B.A. comeback came on Saturday, when her Seattle Storm defeated the Liberty and the vaunted No. 1 draft pick Sabrina Ionescu, 87-71, in the league’s nationally televised season opener. Big-buzz, showcase games like that one are nothing new to Stewart, of course. After winning an Olympic gold medal and four national titles at Connecticut, she led the Storm to the W.N.B.A. title in 2018 and was named the league’s most valuable player. Then came the biggest test of her career: a devastating Achilles rupture that caused her to miss all of last season."+
        
        "Stewart spent months cooped up in Seattle, rehabbing and taking part in Black Lives Matter protests before trekking to Florida at the start of July for the new season. She joined the rest of the W.N.B.A.’s players at the IMG Academy, a 600-acre sports training campus 45 miles from Tampa Bay where all 12 teams are living, training, and sequestering together as they play a shortened 22-game regular season."+
        
        "Stewart’s wait to return to the court has been long and unsettling, with the tedium of recovery stretched out by uncertainty over the league’s return. Having endured all of that, Stewart will finally try to get back to her old normal — winning championships."

        article3: {text1: "LeBron James has seen a great deal during his 17 seasons in the N.B.A. He has already won three championships, and now aspires to win his first with the Los Angeles Lakers. At 35, he is one of the oldest players in the league, with patches of gray showing in the beard he grew out during the four months he recently spent in relative seclusion."+

        "It is not often, then, that James finds himself in a new environment, coping with unusual circumstances that no one could have seen coming. But there he was on Thursday night, stationed on the foul line in a largely empty arena at Walt Disney World, barking defensive assignments at teammates as a game-operations crew piped in artificial crowd noise."+
        
        "James had not played basketball for the (television) viewing public in 135 days, since the N.B.A. suspended its season in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. But if there were questions about how he would look in his much-anticipated return, as the Lakers faced the Dallas Mavericks in a scrimmage ahead of the league’s official restart later this month, he crammed his 15 minutes of playing time full of answers."+
        
        "In short, LeBron James looked exactly the same."+
        
        "There are so few guarantees as the N.B.A. hopes to finish the season in its so-called bubble at the sprawling theme park near Orlando, Fla., but James seems determined to fill his familiar role. Against the Mavericks, he collected 12 points, 5 assists and 3 rebounds while shooting 4 of 6 from the field. He watched the second half from the bench, where he put ice packs on various parts of his body and accessorized his warm-up top with a couple of gold chains. The Mavericks’ 108-104 victory in a game with 10-minute quarters was an afterthought."

        "FORGET THE ASTERISK, NHL PLAYOFFS PRESENT GRUELING TEST"+
        
        "“John Chayka has quit as the General Manager and President of Hockey Operations of the Arizona Coyotes. The Club is disappointed in his actions and his timing as the Coyotes prepare to enter the NHL's hub city of Edmonton, where the team will begin post-season play for the first time since 2012,” the team said in a blistering statement. “Chayka has chosen to quit on a strong and competitive team, a dedicated staff, and the Arizona Coyotes fans, the greatest fans in the NHL.”"+
        
        "Chayka said in a separate statement to AZ Coyote Insider that ownership was making things hard on him."+

        "“I love our players, coaches, staff, and fans and I very much wish I could be with the team in Edmonton. Sadly, the situation created by ownership made that an impossibility,” he said. “That's all I intend to say on this matter for now. A fuller, more detailed explanation may be necessary in the near future.”"+
        
        "Steve Sullivan was named interim general manager."

        "Duilio told the newspaper he believed it was because of his job in law enforcement."+
        
        "He said his position at the school began to come under fire in late June when fliers began to circulate with his face on it and incidents he was involved in as a police officer. The fliers mentioned two incidents involving Duilio from 2001. One was related to an assault by gang-affiliated members and the other was the shooting of Bruce Browne, which led to a $200,000 settlement by the department."+
        "According to Oregon Live, Duilio was asked by the district to talk about the incidents. He said the district told him they “didn’t see a path moving forward because of pressure they’re getting” and he was asked to resign. Duilio declined. He was asked to resign one more time before he was told his contract would not be renewed."+

        "“It’s unjust, from whoever is leading this,” he said. “[Portland Public Schools] still had a role in it. They could have stood up to them.”"
