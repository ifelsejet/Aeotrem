    text1: 'With the consequences of inaction towards climate change becoming ever more catastrophic and dire, we believe you have a responsibility to your users to stop those seeking to blur the lines between facts based on climate science and those peddling pseudoscience,"the letter reportedly reads, also expressing that "the broader safeguards you have adopted have not sufficiently stemmed the tide of disinformation regarding climate change online.'+

    "The letter, for example, raises concerns that adding a Wikipedia link to video with dubious information on climate change is not enough."+ 
    
    'Nowhere on the page is there more contextual information, for example, regarding the source, or where and how the source gathered its data, "the letter says, also explaining that climate change denialism on social media is "feed[ing] a cycle of climate inaction.',
    text2: 
    ` 'The letter also includes six questions for the tech CEOs to answer starting with: "Do you agree that the spread of climate change disinformation on your respective platforms is a problem?"'+
    
    "Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."+ 
    
    "This comes as tech CEOs, including Zuckerberg, are set to testify before Congress this week over antitrust concerns." `

    text1: "Earlier this month, Google delayed the reopening of its US offices after coronavirus cases surged in several states. CEO Sundar Pichai previously said the search giant would start bringing workers back as of July 6, but then said offices will remain closed until at least Sept. 7."+

    "As at many companies, employees at Google have been working from home to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Back in May, Pichai told employees that they'll likely work remotely for the rest of 2020. The Google CEO reportedly made the decision to further push back opening offices last week, in part due to uncertainty around school years."+ 
    
    "As of Monday, the US has recorded more than 4 million confirmed cases, with over 146,000 deaths. Globally, there are over 16 million confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 database."

    article3: { text1: "Upping the pace too, we drop in with the Hargreeves moments after the end of season 1, when they escape Earth's destruction in 2019 thanks to the time-traveling abilities of Five (Aidan Gallagher)."+

    "But the adopted siblings' paths splinter across Dallas, Texas, in the early '60s. Against a backdrop of US-Soviet conflict, with John F. Kennedy's assassination looming, Five discovers he has 10 days to gather the family and prevent events that lead to the world's nuclear destruction."+
    
    "While this Doomsday scenario and other season 1 plot beats echo throughout, season 2 has a self-awareness ensuring we go to unexpected places. When Luther (Tom Hopper) teeters on villainizing Vanya (Ellen Page), for example, we side-step into more mature territory, reflecting growth in the characters as well as the show.",
    text2:
    
    "While Luther's underground-fighter storyline isn't as exciting as the others, we don't stick with him for long. Skipping chunks of time between the characters landing in the past and creating new lives, we see the necessary plot details through flashbacks wisely interspersed across the 10 episodes."+

    "Diego (David Casta√±eda), whos now embracing his heroic side, meets the unpredictable Lila (Ritu Arya). Klaus (Robert Sheehan), unsurprisingly, becomes a Jesus-type leader of a cult. Ghost Ben (Justin H. Min), who still has unfinished business, continues to bicker with Klaus in scenes that produce most of the best lines. But Klaus goes to difficult places too, meeting his Vietnam War love Dave, who doesnt yet know hes gay."+

    "Alison (Emmy Raver-Lampman), whos married to equal rights activist Raymond Chestnut (Yusuf Gatewood), wrestles with how much to use her mind-control powers in the midst of racial tensions. Her difficult experiences make one of the darker threads, touching on the upsetting blacks only and whites only segregation of places like hair salons."

    article4: {text1: "A mature take on the Transformers franchise coupled with the budget and reach of Netflix seems exactly like what fans of the original '80s cartoon, who are now much older and hungering for more-sophisticated storytelling, have been waiting for."+ 

    "The ridiculously long-titled Transformers: War for Cybertron (Chapter 1: Siege) looks at the grim final days of the war on the eponymous robotic race's home planet of Cybertron. It does scratch the itch for deeper character work, and it offers a nice, steady progression toward more chaotic robotic rampage. But at only six episodes, the show sports a plot that feels as if it got shortchanged, and the hints of a deeper backstory about the conflict are frustratingly vague and beg to be fleshed out."

    article5: {text1 : "Researchers placed the fungi aboard the ISS for 30 days and analyzed its ability to block radiation. Fungi, like C. sphaerospermum, contain a pigment known as melanin, which can absorb radiation and turn it into energy."+

    "The researchers set up a petri dish with two sides. On one side, a control containing no fungi, on the other, C. sphaerospermum. Underneath the petri dish was a radiation detector. For 30 days, the detectors measured radiation every 110 seconds. The proof-of-concept study showed that the fungi was able to adapt to microgravity and thrive on radiation. It was able to block some of the incoming radiation, decreasing the levels by almost 2%.",

        text2: 
    "One of the major advantages, the researchers write, is the fungi self-replicates from microscopic amounts. You would only need to send a small amount to orbit, give it some nutrients and let it replicate, forming a biological radiation shield. With some tweaking, the fungi could be used to shield bases on the moon or Mars."+

    "It's a long while until we put boots on the red planet, but the groundwork is being laid now. July has been a big month for Mars exploration. A fleet of robotic explorers are currently en route to the planet -- and NASA's Perseverance rover is set to follow on July 30. If you're keen to see that launch, we've got a big guide ready for your eyeballs. And don't forget -- the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule is coming back to Earth from the ISS on Aug. 2."
